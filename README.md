This is assignment 1 for CSCI2020U. 
This is a Spam Detector that checks a file or a directory/folder and searches 
through every file in a folder called Ham and Spam and makes a list of the occurences.
It then compares the two lists and finds common words and tells you whether a selected folder
has spam or not.

The interface has been improved so that now the Accuracy and Precision is bold, colours have been added
as well to the background, textboxes and text making it look much more aesthetically pleasing.
